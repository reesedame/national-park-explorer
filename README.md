## Description

Utilizing the [National Park Service API](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/index.htm), this app allows you to explore national parks, as well as other sites managed by the National Park Service, by state. Upon opening the app, you will see a map of the United States. Click on a state to view its national parks and sites. Then, click on a park or site to view its details. Details include a description, a link to its official site, images, and amenities (such as restrooms, parking, etc).
